    "text" : "Once upon a time, in the age when ancient myths still walked the earth, there lived a kind-hearted boy named Max in a village nestled between misty mountains. Max had hair the color of autumn chestnuts and eyes that sparkled with curiosity and warmth. He was known throughout the village for his clever mind and generous spirit, always helping neighbors with puzzles they couldn't solve or sharing his last piece of bread with hungry travelers. In his pocket, Max carried his most treasured possession: a magic compass given to him by his grandmother, its golden needle always pointing toward what his heart truly sought.",

Together, they would explore the meadows, solve riddles, and share stories beneath the old oak tree that had stood for a thousand years. Luna admired Max's kindness, and Max treasured Luna's joyful spirit that could brighten even the cloudiest day. One morning, as they sat sharing honeycakes by the village well, Luna pointed toward the distant mountains where an ancient haunted castle loomed like a crown of dark stone against the sky. \"My grandmother says the Ice Queen lives there,\" Luna whispered, \"but I think it's just a story to keep children from wandering too far.\"",

The village elder spoke in hushed, worried tones: \"The Ice Queen has taken her, just as she took children in the old tales. She seeks to freeze their warm hearts and keep them in her frozen palace forever.\" Max's heart filled with determination as he clutched his magic compass tightly.

The castle grew larger with each step, its towers piercing the clouds like icicles reaching for the heavens. As he climbed, the air grew colder and snowflakes began to dance around him, but Max's kind heart kept him warm from within. Suddenly, three ice wolves appeared on the path, their eyes glowing blue and their breath forming frost in the air. Instead of running in fear, clever Max remembered the honeycakes still in his satchel. \"You must be hungry, guarding this lonely mountain,\" he said gently, offering the treats to the fierce creatures.

His breath formed clouds in the frigid air as he followed his compass through the twisting corridors, each turn bringing him closer to Luna. Then, in the great throne room, Max finally beheld the Ice Queen herself: a tall, elegant figure carved from winter itself, with a crown of icicles and robes that shimmered like fresh snow. \"So, another warm-hearted child has come to my castle,\" the Ice Queen said, her voice like wind chimes made of ice. \"Your friend Luna dances now in my courtyard, but soon she will forget all warmth and laughter, becoming as cold and perfect as my frozen kingdom.
